This research evaluates the performance of three advanced classification models: ConvAttention, U-Net, and the network proposed in this paper, called Attention-based U-Net, were implemented with a publicly available MRI dataset with four labels: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal. These models achieved an accuracy of 91.53%, 93.06%, and 95.50%, respectively, with the U-Net model with Attention showing the highest performance.
